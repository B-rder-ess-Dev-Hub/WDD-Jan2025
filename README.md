# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend using TypeScript with type-aware lint rules enabled. Check out the [TS template](https://github.com/vitejs/vite/tree/main/packages/create-vite/template-react-ts) for information on how to integrate TypeScript and [`typescript-eslint`](https://typescript-eslint.io) in your project.

## Step-by-Step Contribution Guide

Welcome to our Web Design and Development Course! In this guide, you'll learn how to contribute your weekly projects to this repository. Follow these steps carefully to ensure your projects are properly added.

### 1. Fork the Repository

Start by forking the WDD-Jan2025 repository to your GitHub account. This creates a personal copy of the repository where you can make changes without affecting the original.

- Go to the repository page: [WDD-Jan2025](https://github.com/B-rder-ess-Dev-Hub/WDD-Jan2025).
- Click the Fork button at the top-right corner of the page.

### 2. Clone the Forked Repository

Clone the repository you just forked to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your_username>/WDD-Jan2025.git
cd WDD-Jan2025
```

### 3. Navigate to the Weekly Project Folder

Each week has a designated project folder inside the repository. Navigate to the folder for the current week (e.g., `week-three`):

```bash
cd week-<week_number>
```

Example:

```bash
cd week-three
```

### 4. Create Your Folder

Inside the weekly folder, create a new folder named after your first name or a unique identifier (e.g., `john`, `jane-doe`):

```bash
mkdir <your_name>
```

Example:

```bash
mkdir john
```

### 5. Add Your Project Files

Place all the files related to your project (code, documentation, assets, etc.) into your folder. Ensure your files are organized and well-documented.

### 6. Commit Your Changes

Stage and commit your changes with a clear and descriptive commit message:

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Week <week_number> project for <your_name>"
```

Example:

```bash
git commit -m "Add Week three project for John Doe"
```

### 7. Push Your Changes

Push your changes to the remote repository.

```bash
git push origin main
```

If you're on a new branch, use the branch name matching your changes (e.g., `week-three-john-project`):

```bash
git push origin <your_branch_name>
```

Example:

```bash
git push origin week-1-john-project
```

### 8. Create a Pull Request

1. Go to the original GitHub repository in your browser: [WDD-Jan2025](https://github.com/B-rder-ess-Dev-Hub/WDD-Jan2025).

2. Click on the Pull Requests tab.

3. Click New Pull Request and select "Compare across forks" if needed.

4. Select your forked repository and branch as the source, and the main branch of the original repository as the destination.

5. Provide a descriptive title and include details about your project in the description.

Example PR Title:

```
Add Week three Project for John Doe
```

### 9. Wait for Review

The repository maintainers will review your pull request. Address any feedback promptly and resubmit if needed.

---

## Additional Notes

- Ensure your project is complete, well-documented, and functional before submitting.

- Follow the repository's coding and folder structure guidelines.

- Create a new folder each week and place all files and assets related to that week's project in the folder.

- If you encounter any issues, contact your tutor for help.

Thank you for contributing to our learning repository! Happy coding!
