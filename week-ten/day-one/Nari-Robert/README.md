JavaScript is a single-threaded, that is, it can only process one task/operation which could be a problem because If one task takes a long time (like downloading a file from the internet), everything behind it has to wait.

To solve that, we make use of "Asynchronous code" so that JavaScript can start a long task (like fetching data), set it aside (give it to the browser or a web API), continue doing other tasks,then come back to it when itâ€™s done.
Asynchronous code helps in improving the performance and responsiveness in the web application.

 HOW AND WHY WE USE fetch()? fetch() is a built-in JavaScript function used to make network requests (typically HTTP).

It returns a Promise, which resolves when the request completes.

Commonly used to get or send data to external APIs.


 WHAT async / await DO AND HOW THEY WORK?

async keyword is used to define asynchronous functions that return a Promise.

await is used inside async functions to pause execution until the Promise is resolved.

Helps write asynchronous code in a cleaner, more readable manner.
