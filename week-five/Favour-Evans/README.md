# WDD Milestone Project

This is a practice website project assigned to me to help me gain a better understanding of how Figma works journey. The design was sourced from Figma, and I recreated it using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The goal of this project was to improve my front-end development skills, including responsive design, layout structuring, and CSS styling.

## Features
- **Responsive Design**: The website is designed to work seamlessly on various screen sizes, from desktops to mobile devices.
- **Modern UI**: A clean and professional user interface based on the Figma design.
- **Interactive Elements**: Includes buttons, links, and other interactive components.

## Technologies Used

- **CSS**: For styling and layout.
